I am a Master’s student at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/), working on computer vision. \
I am also a research fellow at the Koç University & İş Bankası Artificial Intelligence Center ([KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr/)), under the supervision of [Dr. Fatma Güney](https://mysite.ku.edu.tr/fguney/).

I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering with high honor from \
[Boğaziçi University](https://bogazici.edu.tr/en-US/Index).

My research experience includes perception and representation learning for autonomous driving, with a focus on Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception models. 

Recently, I have been interested in utilizing generative models to improve the generalizability of perception models.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
